It was the first day of school. I had very excited. We had waited in front of the computer classroom for the first lesson. Finally! The teacher opened the door.

        <p>Today is September 11 Monday.</p>
<p>It was the first day of school. I had very excited. We had waited in front of the computer classroom for the first lesson. Finally! The teacher opened the door. It was a dark room with a black curtain. Inside the room, there were many tables and in each table there was one computer. They were IBM 8086 PC30.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IBM8086-PC30.png" alt="IBM 8086 PC30"></p>
<p>The teacher took us in. We sat down on the tables. The lesson had started. The teacher said that “Please press the red button on your computer case for starting”. I pressed now. Hard drive sound started. There was some text on the black screen. PC-DOS is loading. Finally, the command prompt arrived. The first command I typed was <code>DIR</code>. Then the teacher asked us to type our own name and press enter. The message we got was <code>Bad command or filename</code>. Since then, I like to use console. Because of this, I had no difficulties on Linux.</p>
<p>I had met the computer with IBM 8086 PC30. I love it.</p>
