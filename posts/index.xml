      <description>I ran into this error when I tried any brew operation (like brew update and brew upgrade) on a Mac. I had just upgraded to macOS Big Sur 11.1 and suddenly brew broke!
$ brew update xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun The fix, luckily, is pretty straight forward. Install the Xcode toolkit! Even if you had it installed before, you might have to re-register it or update it to the latest version.</description>

      <description>Today is September 11 Monday.
It was the first day of school. I had very excited. We had waited in front of the computer classroom for the first lesson. Finally! The teacher opened the door. It was a dark room with a black curtain. Inside the room, there were many tables and in each table there was one computer. They were IBM 8086 PC30.
The teacher took us in. We sat down on the tables.</description>

      <description>I had always been a child who wondered. What is what? How it works?
I had interested in electronic circuit components and electronic circuits until I meet the computer. I made many electronics circuits flip-flops, amplifiers, FM-Radio, PIC16F87, etc. Right now I develop electronics projects and Machine Learning applications with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Nvidia Jetson.
One time, When I was 15, I made FM-Radio with my grandpa. He had wonder like me, and he always has liked new things.</description>

      <description>For a long time, I want to write a blog, and I&amp;rsquo;m here. Here we go.
I preferred to start with Hugo for my blog, but I had thought Jekyll previously. Nowadays, I interested in Golang, therefore, I preferred Hugo. My website preparation works will continue for a while. Thank you for your patience.
On my personal website, youâ€™ll find the programs I use, my love of code, techs I use, and my ever-evolving workspace.</description>
